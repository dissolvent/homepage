## Hi!

My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé. 
Primarily making it for [binary-studio academy 2020](https://academy.binary-studio.com/en). 
Trying different GitHub tools like [Project management](https://github.com/features/project-management/), [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and many others.
